# Muser
## Reddit threads and Youtube comment sections can be great places to discuss your favorite songs with others, but sometimes it can be difficult to find the songs you want to discuss; the scope of these platforms is too large to serve such a specific purpose well. This inconvenience inspired the creation of Muser, a discussion platform for a global community of music enthusiasts. Using your Spotify credentials, you can preview every song from the Spotify library, and comment on those songs.

## Once you sign in with your Spotify account you will land on a page where you can search by artist, song, or album.

## After the page with all the relevant results loads, you can choose what search to get more information on.

## This brings you to a comment page where you can see what other people have written, add your own comments, and update your comments.
